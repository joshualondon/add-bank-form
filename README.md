# Add Bank Entry
A prototype I created for adding bank accounts as a payment method. An API call is made to routingnumbers.info go retrieve bank data and display it in the faux check.

## What's missing

- Validation for:
	- Special characters in number inputs

- Error handling for:
	- Incorrect routing number
	- Max lenght for all inputs
